@article{pyfai,
   abstract = {The pyFAI package has been designed to reduce X-ray diffraction images into powder diffraction curves to be further processed by scientists. This contribution describes how to convert an image into a radial profile using the Numpy package, how the process was accelerated using Cython. The algorithm was parallelised, needing a complete re-design to benefit from massively parallel devices like graphical processing units or accelerators like the Intel Xeon Phi using the PyOpenCL library.},

@article{film-texture-sim,
   abstract = {Computationally efficient simulations of grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) are discussed, with particular attention given to textured thin polycrystalline films on supporting substrates. A computer program has been developed for simulating scattering from thin films exhibiting varying degrees of preferred orientation. One emphasized common case is that of a 'fibre' symmetry axis perpendicular to the sample plane, resulting from crystallites having one well defined crystal facet towards the substrate, but no preferred in-plane orientation. Peak splitting caused by additional scattering from the totally substrate-reflected beam (two-beam approximation) and refraction effects are also included in the program, together with the geometrical intensity corrections associated with GIXD measurements. To achieve 'user friendliness' for scientists less familiar with diffraction, the mathematically simplest possible descriptions are sought whenever feasible. The practical use of the program is demonstrated for a selected thin-film example, perylene, which is of relevance for organic electronics. © International Union of Crystallography 2008.},
