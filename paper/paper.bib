This contribution describes how to convert an image into a radial profile using the Numpy package, how the process was accelerated using Cython. The algorithm was parallelised, needing a complete re-design to benefit from massively parallel devices like graphical processing units or accelerators like the Intel Xeon Phi using the PyOpenCL library.},

@article{how-to-giwaxs,
   abstract = {The frequency of reports utilizing synchrotron-based grazing incident wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) to study metal halide perovskite thin films has exploded recently, as this technique has proven invaluable for understanding several structure-property relationships that fundamentally limit optoelectronic performance. The GIWAXS geometry and temporal resolution are also inherently compatible with in situ and operando setups (including ISOS protocols), and a relatively large halide perovskite research community has deployed GIWAXS to unravel important kinetic and dynamic features in these materials. Considering its rising popularity, the aim here is to accelerate the required learning curve for new experimentalists by clearly detailing the underlying analytical concepts which can be leveraged to maximize GIWAXS studies of polycrystalline thin films and devices. Motivated by the vast range of measurement conditions offered, together with the wide variety of compositions and structural motifs available (i.e., from single-crystal and polycrystalline systems, to quantum dots and layered superlatices), a comprehensive framework for conducting effective GIWAXS experiments is outlined for different purposes. It is anticipated that providing a clear perspective for this topic will help elevate the quality of future GIWAXS studies—which have become routine—and provide the impetus required to develop novel GIWAXS approaches to resolve unsettled scientific questions.},

@article{quantify-film-alignment,
   abstract = {As thin films become increasingly popular (for solar cells, LEDs, microelectronics, batteries), quantitative morphological and crystallography information is needed to predict and optimize the film's electrical, optical, and mechanical properties. This quantification can be obtained quickly and easily with X-ray diffraction using an area detector in two sample geometries. In this paper, we describe a methodology for constructing complete pole figures for thin films with fiber texture (isotropic in-plane orientation). We demonstrate this technique on semicrystalline polymer films, self-assembled nanoparticle semiconductor films, and randomly packed metallic nanoparticle films. This method can be immediately implemented to help understand the relationship between film processing and microstructure, enabling the development of better and less expensive electronic and optoelectronic devices. © 2010 American Chemical Society.},
